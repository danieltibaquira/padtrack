# Bug Fixes and CI Compatibility Summary

## üêõ Anti-Aliasing Logic Bug Fix

### Issue
The anti-aliasing logic in `processRingModulationAntiAliased` was inverted, causing aliasing artifacts when anti-aliasing should have been applied.

### Location
`Sources/VoiceModule/OscillatorModulation.swift` line 180

### Original Code (Buggy)
```swift
if !smoothedParams.antiAliasing || shouldApplyAntiAliasing(fundamental: fundamental) {
    return processRingModulation(carrierSample: carrierSample, modulatorSample: modulatorSample, depth: depth)
}
```

### Fixed Code
```swift
if !smoothedParams.antiAliasing || !shouldApplyAntiAliasing(fundamental: fundamental) {
    return processRingModulation(carrierSample: carrierSample, modulatorSample: modulatorSample, depth: depth)
}
```

### Explanation
The bug was in the condition logic. The corrected logic now properly:

1. **When anti-aliasing is disabled** (`!smoothedParams.antiAliasing` is true): Uses non-anti-aliased processing
2. **When anti-aliasing is enabled AND frequency is low** (`!shouldApplyAntiAliasing(fundamental)` is true): Uses non-anti-aliased processing (optimization)
3. **When anti-aliasing is enabled AND frequency is high** (both conditions false): Uses anti-aliased processing with oversampling and filtering

This ensures anti-aliasing is only applied when both enabled and necessary for high frequencies.

## üîß CI/CD Compatibility Fixes

### Swift Tools Version Downgrade

**File:** `Package.swift`

**Changes:**
- Downgraded from `swift-tools-version: 6.0` to `swift-tools-version: 5.10`
- Removed `swiftLanguageModes: [.v5, .v6]` (not available in Swift 5.10)

**Reason:** CI environment has Swift 5.10.0 installed, not Swift 6.0

### SwiftLint Compliance

**Files Modified:**
- `Tests/FilterMachineTests/Lowpass4FilterMachineTests.swift`
- `Tests/FXModuleTests/TrackFXProcessorTests.swift`
- `Tests/MachineProtocolsTests/MachineProtocolsTests.swift`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `print()` statements with comments
- Maintained debugging information as comments for development reference
- Eliminated custom rule violations for "No Print Statements"

## üß™ Validation of Changes

### Anti-Aliasing Logic Validation

The fixed logic correctly handles these scenarios:

1. **Low Frequency (1000 Hz)** with AA enabled:
   - `shouldApplyAntiAliasing(1000)` returns `false` (below 25% Nyquist ‚âà 5512 Hz)
   - Condition: `false || true` = `true` ‚Üí Uses non-AA processing ‚úÖ

2. **High Frequency (10000 Hz)** with AA enabled:
   - `shouldApplyAntiAliasing(10000)` returns `true` (above 25% Nyquist)
   - Condition: `false || false` = `false` ‚Üí Uses AA processing ‚úÖ

3. **Any Frequency** with AA disabled:
   - Condition: `true || X` = `true` ‚Üí Uses non-AA processing ‚úÖ

### Swift 5.10 Compatibility

**Compatible Features Used:**
- `@unchecked Sendable` (available since Swift 5.5)
- `@MainActor` (available since Swift 5.5)
- `nonisolated` (available since Swift 5.5)
- `async`/`await` syntax (available since Swift 5.5)

**No Swift 6.0 Specific Features:**
- No typed throws
- No `consuming`/`borrowing` parameters
- No Swift 6.0 concurrency improvements
- No new Swift 6.0 language modes

## üìä Expected CI Results

With these fixes, the CI pipeline should now:

1. **‚úÖ Build Successfully:** Swift 5.10 compatibility restored
2. **‚úÖ Pass Tests:** Anti-aliasing logic functions correctly
3. **‚úÖ Pass Linting:** No print statement violations
4. **‚úÖ Audio Quality:** Proper anti-aliasing prevents artifacts

## üéØ Summary

- **Bug Fixed:** Anti-aliasing logic corrected to prevent audio artifacts
- **CI Compatible:** Downgraded to Swift 5.10 for CI environment
- **Lint Clean:** Removed print statements to satisfy SwiftLint rules
- **Quality Maintained:** All audio processing logic integrity preserved

The codebase is now ready for successful CI/CD pipeline execution with proper anti-aliasing behavior and no build failures.
