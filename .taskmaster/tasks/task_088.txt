# Task ID: 88
# Title: Implement Comprehensive File Management Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 60, 61, 62, 63
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite to validate all import/export functionality, file format compatibility, and data integrity across all target iPad devices.
# Details:
This task involves developing a robust testing framework to validate Checkpoint 13 requirements for file management capabilities:

1. Create a test plan document outlining all test cases for:
   - Audio recording functionality
   - Audio export in all supported formats
   - Project import/export operations
   - MIDI file import/export operations

2. Implement automated test cases where possible:
   - Unit tests for file format validation
   - Integration tests for import/export operations
   - Stress tests with large files and projects
   - Error handling tests for corrupted files and edge cases

3. Develop a manual testing protocol for device-specific validation:
   - Create step-by-step test procedures for each device
   - Design test projects of varying complexity for import/export testing
   - Create reference files in all supported formats for validation

4. Implement data integrity validation tools:
   - Checksums for exported files
   - Comparison utilities for before/after import/export cycles
   - Metadata validation for all file types

5. Create a reporting framework:
   - Test result collection and aggregation
   - Format compatibility matrix
   - Performance metrics for import/export operations
   - Device-specific issue tracking

6. Develop a continuous integration pipeline for file management testing:
   - Automated test execution
   - Regression testing for file operations
   - Performance benchmarking across devices

The testing suite should be configurable to run on all target devices: iPad Pro 11-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch, iPad Air, and iPad mini, with results that can be compared across devices.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will validate the complete file management system through:

1. Automated Testing:
   - Execute all unit and integration tests for file operations
   - Verify checksums and binary comparisons of files before and after import/export
   - Run performance tests measuring import/export times for various file sizes
   - Test all supported file formats with valid and invalid files
   - Validate error handling with corrupted or malformed files

2. Manual Device Testing:
   - Deploy the application to all target devices (iPad Pro 11-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch, iPad Air, iPad mini)
   - For each device, execute the complete test protocol:
     * Record audio at various quality settings and verify recordings
     * Export projects in all supported formats and verify on external applications
     * Import projects from various sources and verify all data is preserved
     * Test MIDI import/export with standard MIDI files from different sources
     * Verify cross-device compatibility by importing files created on different devices

3. Validation Criteria:
   - All import/export operations complete without errors
   - Exported files are readable by industry-standard applications
   - Imported files preserve all original data and metadata
   - Operations are reliable under stress conditions (low storage, background processes)
   - Performance meets acceptable thresholds on all devices

4. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Generate comprehensive test reports for each device
   - Document any device-specific issues or limitations
   - Create a format compatibility matrix showing support levels
   - Produce a final validation report confirming Checkpoint 13 requirements are met

The task is considered complete when all tests pass on all target devices and the final validation report is approved.
