# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Variable Track Length and Speed
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 19, 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for individual track lengths and speeds.
# Details:
Implement variable track length and speed with:
- UI for setting track length and speed
- Storage in the data model
- Visual indication of track settings
- Proper handling during playback

Add length and speed parameters to the Track entity. Implement UI controls for setting these values. Update the sequencer to handle different track lengths and speeds during playback. Add visual indication of track settings in the UI.

# Test Strategy:
Test tracks with various lengths and speeds. Verify that playback correctly handles different track configurations. Test polyrhythmic patterns with different track lengths. Test changing track settings during playback.
