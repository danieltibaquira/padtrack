# Task ID: 83
# Title: Implement MIDI System Testing and Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 42, 43, 44
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework to validate the MIDI system functionality across different iPad models, ensuring reliable hardware integration, accurate CC mapping, and precise MIDI timing.
# Details:
Implement a systematic testing framework for the MIDI system with the following components:

1. Device Compatibility Testing:
   - Create a test harness that validates MIDI I/O on iPad Pro 11-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch, iPad Air, and iPad mini
   - Implement automated detection of connected MIDI devices
   - Test with various MIDI controllers and hardware synthesizers
   - Document device-specific behaviors or limitations

2. MIDI I/O Validation:
   - Implement test cases for MIDI input detection and handling
   - Create test patterns for MIDI output generation
   - Verify bidirectional MIDI communication
   - Test MIDI channel routing and filtering

3. CC Mapping Verification:
   - Create test cases for each CC mapping functionality
   - Implement validation for parameter response to CC input
   - Test MIDI learn functionality across different controllers
   - Verify persistence of CC mappings between app sessions

4. MIDI Timing Analysis:
   - Implement precise timing measurement for MIDI events
   - Create test cases for jitter and latency measurement
   - Compare internal clock timing with MIDI clock timing
   - Test synchronization with external MIDI clock sources

5. MIDI Track Sequencing Tests:
   - Create test patterns for sequencing external hardware
   - Implement validation of note on/off timing accuracy
   - Test CC automation in MIDI tracks
   - Verify proper handling of MIDI program changes

6. Reporting System:
   - Create a structured reporting format for test results
   - Implement logging of all MIDI events during testing
   - Generate compatibility reports for different hardware combinations
   - Document any timing inconsistencies or hardware-specific issues

The implementation should use XCTest for automated testing where possible, combined with manual testing procedures for hardware-specific validation. Create a dedicated TestMIDISystem class that interfaces with the MIDIModule to run the tests and collect results.

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Create unit tests for MIDI message parsing and generation
   - Implement integration tests for the MIDIModule interfaces
   - Create UI tests for CC mapping and MIDI track configuration
   - Measure and log timing precision using high-resolution timers

2. Hardware Testing Matrix:
   - Create a test matrix covering all supported iPad models
   - Test with at least 3 different types of MIDI controllers (keyboard, pad controller, control surface)
   - Test with at least 2 different hardware synthesizers
   - Document all hardware combinations in the test report

3. MIDI I/O Validation:
   - Send test MIDI note patterns and verify correct reception
   - Test all 16 MIDI channels for input and output
   - Verify handling of MIDI System Exclusive messages
   - Test MIDI Thru functionality

4. CC Mapping Validation:
   - Map CCs to various parameters and verify response
   - Test edge cases (min/max values, rapid CC changes)
   - Verify MIDI learn functionality with different controllers
   - Test persistence of mappings across app restarts

5. Timing Precision Tests:
   - Measure timing accuracy of MIDI clock generation
   - Test synchronization with external MIDI clock
   - Measure latency between UI actions and MIDI output
   - Verify consistent timing across different device loads

6. Performance Testing:
   - Test MIDI system under high CPU load conditions
   - Measure performance with multiple MIDI tracks active
   - Test with maximum polyphony and CC automation
   - Monitor for timing degradation under stress

7. Acceptance Criteria:
   - MIDI I/O functions correctly on all tested devices
   - CC mapping responds accurately with <5ms latency
   - MIDI tracks sequence external gear with <10ms jitter
   - All hardware compatibility tests pass
   - Timing precision meets professional standards (Â±1ms)
   - Generate comprehensive test report documenting all results
