# Description: Add support for recording audio output.
# Details:
Implement audio recording with:
- Recording of the master output to audio files
- Format selection (WAV, AIFF, etc.)
- Recording controls (start, stop, pause)
- Integration with the file system

Implement the audio recording engine using AVAudioEngine's tap functionality. Add UI for controlling recording operations. Implement format selection for output files. Add integration with the file system for saving recordings.
