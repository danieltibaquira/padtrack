# Task ID: 55
# Title: Implement Envelopes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add envelopes for parameter modulation.
# Details:
Implement envelopes with:
- ADSR or ADE/ASDE shapes
- Trigger modes (gate, trigger, loop)
- Destination routing to parameters
- Velocity sensitivity

Implement the envelope engine with multiple independent envelopes. Add UI for controlling envelope parameters. Implement destination routing to assign envelopes to parameters. Add trigger modes for different behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test envelopes with various shapes and settings. Verify that parameters are correctly modulated. Test trigger modes. Test with multiple envelopes assigned to different parameters.
