# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Core Data Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the Core Data model entities for the application.
# Details:
Create the Core Data model with the following entities and relationships:
1. Project: Contains Patterns and a PresetPool
2. Pattern: Contains a Kit, Tracks, tempo, length
3. Kit: A collection of 16 Presets + FX/Mixer settings
4. Track: Contains Trigs and a reference to a Preset
5. Trig: Contains step data, pitch, velocity, duration, and pLocks
6. Preset: Contains all parameters for a specific Machine

Implement NSManagedObject subclasses for each entity with appropriate properties and relationships. Use Core Data code generation for attribute classes.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify CRUD operations for all entities. Test relationship integrity and constraints. Verify that saving and loading operations work correctly.

## 8. Set up Core Data stack [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Implement the Core Data stack to manage the persistent store and context.
### Details:
Create a CoreDataStack class to handle the managed object context, persistent store coordinator, and persistent container. Implement methods for saving and fetching data.

## 9. Generate NSManagedObject subclasses [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Create custom NSManagedObject subclasses for each entity in the Core Data model.
### Details:
Use Xcode's code generation feature or manually create NSManagedObject subclasses for Project, Pattern, Kit, Track, Trig, and Preset entities. Implement custom methods and computed properties as needed.

## 10. Implement data validation rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9
### Description: Create and implement data validation rules for all entities and their attributes.
### Details:
Define validation rules for each entity's attributes (e.g., required fields, value ranges, format checks). Implement these rules in the NSManagedObject subclasses or using Core Data's validation methods.

## 11. Create CRUD operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.8, 2.9
### Description: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all entities.
### Details:
Create methods to perform CRUD operations on each entity. Implement error handling and ensure data consistency across related entities.

## 12. Implement data migration strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.8
### Description: Design and implement a strategy for handling future Core Data model changes.
### Details:
Create a versioning and migration strategy for the Core Data model. Implement lightweight migrations and prepare for potential heavy migrations in the future.

## 13. Write unit tests for Core Data model [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.9, 2.10, 2.11
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all Core Data entities and operations.
### Details:
Write tests for entity creation, relationship management, validation rules, CRUD operations, and edge cases. Use in-memory store for testing to improve performance.
