# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Core Data Models
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the Core Data model entities for the application.
# Details:
Create the Core Data model with the following entities and relationships:
1. Project: Contains Patterns and a PresetPool
2. Pattern: Contains a Kit, Tracks, tempo, length
3. Kit: A collection of 16 Presets + FX/Mixer settings
4. Track: Contains Trigs and a reference to a Preset
5. Trig: Contains step data, pitch, velocity, duration, and pLocks
6. Preset: Contains all parameters for a specific Machine

Implement NSManagedObject subclasses for each entity with appropriate properties and relationships. Use Core Data code generation for attribute classes.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify CRUD operations for all entities. Test relationship integrity and constraints. Verify that saving and loading operations work correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Data model diagram [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive diagram of the Core Data model, including all entities, attributes, and relationships.
### Details:
Use a diagramming tool to visually represent the Core Data model. Include entities: Project, Pattern, Kit, Track, Trig, and Preset. Show all attributes and relationships between entities.

# Core Data Model Design Plan

## Entity Identification
- Review DigitonePad requirements and identify main entities: Project, Pattern, Kit, Track, Trig, Preset.

## Entity Attributes and Relationships
- Project: name, createdAt, updatedAt, [patterns], [kits], [presets]
- Pattern: name, order, [tracks], parentProject
- Kit: name, [presets], parentProject
- Track: type, order, [trigs], parentPattern, parentKit
- Trig: step, note, velocity, length, parameterLocks, parentTrack
- Preset: name, type, data, parentKit, parentProject

## Relationship Mapping
- Project 1:N Pattern, 1:N Kit, 1:N Preset
- Pattern 1:N Track
- Kit 1:N Preset
- Track 1:N Trig
- Preset N:1 Kit, N:1 Project

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a diagram using either Mermaid or Xcode Data Model
2. Document rationale for each entity and relationship
3. Generate and commit the diagram
4. Mark subtask as complete when finished

## 2. Implement Project entity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Project entity with all necessary attributes and relationships.
### Details:
Define attributes such as name, creationDate, and lastModifiedDate. Set up relationships with Pattern, Kit, and Preset entities. Implement any required validation rules.
<info added on 2025-06-13T04:03:46.132Z>
Define the Project entity for Core Data with attributes: name (String), createdAt (Date), updatedAt (Date).

Set up relationships:
- patterns (to-many relationship with Pattern entity)
- kits (to-many relationship with Kit entity)
- presets (to-many relationship with Preset entity)

Add inverse relationships:
- From Pattern entity back to Project
- From Kit entity back to Project
- From Preset entity back to Project

Document the entity definition and rationale in code comments.

Implementation steps:
1. Add Project entity to Core Data model
2. Define attributes and relationships
3. Set up validation rules for name (required, non-empty)
4. Configure delete rules for relationships
5. Commit changes to version control
