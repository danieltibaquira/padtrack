# Task ID: 71
# Title: Implement Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create integration tests for module interactions.
# Details:
Implement integration tests with:
- Test coverage for module interactions
- End-to-end testing of critical paths
- Performance testing of integrated systems
- Error handling and recovery testing

Create test cases for module interactions. Test end-to-end functionality for critical paths like sequencer to audio engine communication. Add performance testing for integrated systems. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Run integration tests as part of the CI pipeline. Verify that all tests pass consistently. Monitor for integration issues between modules. Add new tests as features are added.
