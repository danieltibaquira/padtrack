# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 32, 33, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and execute a comprehensive testing plan for P-Lock functionality and recording modes (GRID, LIVE, STEP) across multiple iPad models to ensure consistent performance and reliability.
# Details:
This task involves creating a structured testing framework to validate the advanced sequencer features across different iPad models:

1. Setup testing environment:
   - Configure test devices: iPad Pro 11-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch, iPad Air, and iPad mini
   - Install latest development build on all devices
   - Prepare test patterns with various complexity levels (simple to complex)

2. P-Lock functionality testing:
   - Verify P-Lock creation (hold step + turn encoder)
   - Test P-Lock editing and deletion
   - Validate visual indication of P-Locked parameters
   - Test P-Lock behavior during pattern playback
   - Verify P-Lock automation smoothness at different tempos
   - Test P-Lock interaction with pattern length changes
   - Validate P-Lock persistence when saving/loading projects

3. Recording modes testing:
   - GRID mode:
     - Test step activation/deactivation
     - Verify parameter editing for steps
     - Test interaction with P-Lock system
     - Validate visual feedback

   - LIVE mode:
     - Test real-time recording at various tempos
     - Verify quantization options
     - Test count-in and metronome functionality
     - Validate record enable/disable behavior
     - Test overdub functionality

   - STEP mode:
     - Verify step-by-step note entry
     - Test automatic advancement
     - Validate parameter editing per step
     - Test integration with P-Lock system

4. Cross-device performance validation:
   - Measure and document UI responsiveness on each device
   - Test for rendering differences between device sizes
   - Validate touch accuracy and sensitivity
   - Measure CPU/memory usage during intensive operations
   - Test battery consumption during extended use

5. Workflow efficiency assessment:
   - Document number of steps required for common operations
   - Identify potential bottlenecks or friction points
   - Compare workflow efficiency across device sizes
   - Gather feedback on ergonomics for different hand sizes

6. Create comprehensive test report:
   - Document all test results by feature and device
   - Highlight any inconsistencies or device-specific issues
   - Provide recommendations for optimization
   - Include performance metrics and comparison data

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Create UI tests for basic functionality verification
   - Implement performance benchmarks for each device
   - Set up automated regression tests for core features

2. Manual Testing Protocol:
   - Create a standardized test script covering all features
   - For each device:
     - Execute full test script documenting results
     - Perform stress tests with complex patterns (64+ steps with multiple P-Locks)
     - Test boundary conditions (maximum number of P-Locks, rapid parameter changes)
   
3. P-Lock Specific Tests:
   - Create test patterns with P-Locks on multiple parameters
   - Verify parameter changes are smooth with no audible artifacts
   - Test extreme parameter value changes
   - Verify P-Lock behavior during pattern loop points
   - Validate P-Lock interaction with different time signatures

4. Recording Mode Tests:
   - For each recording mode, create test scenarios with predefined expected outcomes
   - Verify input capture accuracy using reference patterns
   - Test mode switching during active recording
   - Validate quantization accuracy at different grid resolutions
   - Test recording with external MIDI controllers

5. Cross-Device Validation:
   - Create a comparison matrix of all features across devices
   - Document UI scaling and touch response differences
   - Measure and compare load times and rendering performance
   - Test multitasking scenarios (split screen, slide over)

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All P-Lock functionality works consistently across devices
   - All recording modes capture input accurately
   - No data loss occurs during extended use
   - UI remains responsive during intensive operations
   - Parameter automation is smooth with no audible artifacts
   - Workflow is intuitive and efficient on all screen sizes
   - Battery consumption is within acceptable limits

7. Final Deliverables:
   - Comprehensive test report with device-specific findings
   - Performance comparison data across devices
   - Recorded demonstration of all features working on each device
   - List of any device-specific optimizations needed
