# Task ID: 52
# Title: Implement Performance Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add performance controls for real-time manipulation.
# Details:
Implement performance controls with:
- Macro controls for multiple parameters
- Performance pads for triggering events
- Scene storage and recall
- MIDI mapping for external control

Implement UI for performance controls. Add macro controls that affect multiple parameters simultaneously. Implement performance pads for triggering events or patterns. Add scene storage and recall for quick access to different states.

# Test Strategy:
Test macro controls with various parameter mappings. Verify that performance pads correctly trigger events. Test scene storage and recall. Test MIDI mapping for external control.
