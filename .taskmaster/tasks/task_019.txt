# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Basic Sequencer UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the UI for the basic sequencer functionality.
# Details:
Implement the basic sequencer UI with:
- 16 step buttons with state indication (active, current, p-locked)
- Transport controls (play, stop, record)
- Mode selection (GRID, LIVE, STEP)
- Track selection buttons
- Pattern selection interface

Bind UI controls to the sequencer module. Implement visual feedback for the current step during playback. Use animations for smooth visual updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test step button interaction for creating and deleting steps. Verify that transport controls work correctly. Test that the current step is correctly highlighted during playback. Test track and pattern selection.

3. Write UI automation tests for basic interactions
4. Ensure layout is responsive and follows design guidelines

## 3. Develop core sequencer logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Implement the core sequencer logic in the Interactor, including step activation and basic playback functionality.
