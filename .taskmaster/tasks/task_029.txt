# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Micro Timing for Sequencer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add micro timing adjustments to sequencer steps.
# Details:
Implement micro timing with:
- Per-step timing offset controls
- Visual indication of micro timing in the UI
- Storage in the data model
- Playback during sequencer operation

Add timing offset to the Trig entity. Implement precise timing adjustments during playback. Add UI controls for setting micro timing values.

# Test Strategy:
Test micro timing with various offset values. Verify that notes are triggered at the correct adjusted times. Test with extreme timing values. Measure timing accuracy with audio analysis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up VIPER architecture for micro timing module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic VIPER structure for the micro timing feature, including View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router components.
### Details:
1. Create empty files for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router
2. Define basic protocols for each component
3. Implement basic initialization and connections between components
4. Write unit tests for component interactions

## 2. Implement core micro timing logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core functionality for micro timing in the Interactor, following TDD principles.
### Details:
1. Write failing tests for micro timing calculations
2. Implement micro timing logic in the Interactor
3. Refactor and optimize the code
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Add integration tests for timing accuracy

## 3. Create UI for micro timing display [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Design and implement the user interface for displaying micro timing information in the sequencer.
### Details:
1. Create a basic UI layout for micro timing display
2. Implement data binding between Presenter and View
3. Add real-time updates for timing information
4. Write UI automation tests for timing display
5. Perform usability testing and gather feedback
