# Task ID: 69
# Title: Implement Unit Tests for Core Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for core modules.
# Details:
Implement unit tests for core modules with:
- Test coverage for all critical functionality
- Mocking of dependencies
- Performance tests
- Edge case testing

Create XCTest test cases for all core modules. Use dependency injection and mocking to isolate components for testing. Add performance tests for critical paths. Test edge cases and error conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Run tests automatically as part of the CI pipeline. Verify that all tests pass consistently. Monitor test coverage to ensure comprehensive testing. Add new tests as bugs are discovered.
