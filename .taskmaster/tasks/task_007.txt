# Task ID: 7
# Title: Design UIComponents Swift Package
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create reusable SwiftUI components that mimic the Digitone hardware interface.
# Details:
Implement the UIComponents Swift Package with:
- DigitoneButton: Customizable button with Digitone styling
- DigitoneEncoder: Rotary encoder with value display
- DigitoneDisplay: LCD-style display component
- DigitoneKeyboard: On-screen musical keyboard
- DigitoneGrid: 16-step grid for sequencer visualization

Use SwiftUI with custom drawing where needed. Implement haptic feedback for buttons and encoders. Ensure components are responsive and match the hardware look and feel.

# Test Strategy:
Create preview providers for all components. Test interaction with SwiftUI previews. Verify that components respond correctly to user input and state changes.
