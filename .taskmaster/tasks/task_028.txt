# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Additional Filter Machines
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Create additional filter types (Comb, EQ, etc.).
# Details:
Implement additional filter machines with:
- Comb Filter: Positive and negative feedback with tunable frequency
- EQ: Multi-band equalizer with low, mid, and high controls
- Additional filter types as specified

Implement each filter as a separate class conforming to the FilterMachine protocol. Use efficient DSP algorithms appropriate for each filter type. Ensure consistent parameter naming and behavior across filter types.

# Test Strategy:
Test each filter type with various input signals. Verify frequency response using FFT analysis. Test parameter ranges and edge cases. Ensure stability with extreme settings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement filter machine interface [pending]

### Details:
1. Define FilterMachine protocol
2. Create FilterMachinePresenter and FilterMachineInteractor
3. Implement basic View and Router
4. Write unit tests for each component

## 2. Develop UI for filter selection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create user interface elements for selecting and applying filters
### Details:
1. Design filter selection UI
2. Implement UI components in FilterMachineView
3. Add user interaction handling in Presenter

## 3. Implement filter application logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2
### Description: Develop the core functionality for applying selected filters to images
### Details:
1. Implement filter application logic in Interactor
2. Create unit tests for filter application
3. Integrate filter application with UI in Presenter
4. Perform integration tests between UI and filter logic
