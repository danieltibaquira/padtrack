# Task ID: 11
# Title: Connect Sequencer to Audio Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the SequencerModule with the AudioEngine to trigger notes.
# Details:
Connect the sequencer to the audio engine by:
- Creating a bridge between sequencer events and voice triggering
- Implementing note-on and note-off handling
- Setting up parameter automation from P-Locks
- Configuring proper timing synchronization

Use Combine publishers/subscribers for loose coupling. Ensure sample-accurate timing for note events. Implement thread-safe communication between sequencer and audio threads.

# Test Strategy:
Test that notes are triggered at the correct times. Verify that P-Lock automation is applied correctly. Test with complex patterns to ensure timing stability. Measure latency between sequencer events and audio output.
