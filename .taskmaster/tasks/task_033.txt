# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement LIVE Recording Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the LIVE recording mode for real-time input.
# Details:
Implement LIVE recording mode with:
- Real-time note recording from on-screen keyboard
- Quantization options
- Record enable/disable
- Count-in and metronome

Implement the UI and interaction logic for LIVE mode. Add support for recording notes in real-time. Implement quantization to align notes to the grid. Add metronome functionality for timing reference.

# Test Strategy:
Test note recording with various quantization settings. Verify that notes are correctly stored in the data model. Test with different tempos and time signatures. Test record enable/disable functionality.
