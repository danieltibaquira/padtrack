# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement SequencerModule Swift Package Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the SequencerModule Swift Package with clock and basic sequencing infrastructure.
# Details:
Implement the SequencerModule Swift Package with:
- SequencerClock for timing and synchronization
- Event publishers using Combine framework
- Basic step sequencing logic
- Integration with the DataLayer for reading pattern data

Use high-precision timing with dispatch sources or audio clock for sample-accurate sequencing. Implement proper thread safety with a dedicated sequencer thread. Use Combine publishers to broadcast sequencer events to subscribers.

# Test Strategy:
Test clock accuracy and stability. Verify that events are published at the correct times. Test with different tempos and time signatures. Ensure thread safety with concurrent operations.
