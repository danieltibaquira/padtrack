# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement DataLayer Swift Package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the DataLayer Swift Package with Core Data stack and persistence logic.
# Details:
Implement the DataLayer Swift Package with:
- PersistenceController for managing the Core Data stack
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Migration support for future schema changes
- Methods for creating default/template projects
- Utility methods for common data operations
- Resolve entity conflicts and NSManagedObject subclass generation issues

Use the latest Core Data best practices including NSPersistentContainer and performBackgroundTask for thread safety. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

- Checking for duplicate entity definitions across model versions
- Resolving conflicts between manual and auto-generated NSManagedObject subclasses
<info added on 2025-06-13T16:13:03.901Z>
✅ RESOLVED: NSManagedObject subclass generation issues successfully fixed!

## Root Cause Analysis:
The issue was in the test infrastructure, not the actual Core Data model or NSManagedObject subclasses. Multiple test files were creating their own programmatic NSManagedObjectModel instances, causing conflicts where multiple NSEntityDescriptions claimed the same NSManagedObject subclasses.

## Solution Implemented:
1. **Replaced programmatic model creation with shared singleton**: Modified `CoreDataTestBase.swift` to use a single shared `NSManagedObjectModel` instead of each test creating its own model
2. **Added all missing relationships**: Updated the programmatic test model to include all relationships from the actual Core Data model:
   - Project ↔ Patterns, Kits, Presets
   - Pattern ↔ Project, Tracks, Kit, Trigs  
   - Track ↔ Pattern, Kit, Preset, Trigs
   - Trig ↔ Track, Pattern
   - Kit ↔ Pattern, Project, Tracks
   - Preset ↔ Project, Tracks
3. **Fixed Swift 6 concurrency**: Added `@preconcurrency import CoreData` to resolve concurrency warnings

## Verification Results:
- ✅ Swift package builds successfully: `swift build` (0.29s)
- ✅ iOS project builds successfully: `xcodebuild` completed without errors
- ✅ No more "Multiple NSEntityDescriptions claim the NSManagedObject subclass" errors
- ✅ Tests run without Core Data conflicts (99 tests executed, only 9 failures related to incorrect test expectations about cascade delete behavior, not Core Data issues)

## Key Technical Details:
- Used singleton pattern for shared test model to prevent multiple model instances
- Properly configured all inverse relationships with correct cardinality
- Maintained full compatibility with existing NSManagedObject subclasses
- All entity class names properly prefixed with module name (DataLayer.Project, etc.)

The Core Data model and NSManagedObject subclasses are now working correctly in both test and production environments.

## 18. Fix Core Data Configuration Conflicts [done]
### Dependencies: 3.17
### Description: Resolve Core Data configuration conflicts causing test failures
### Details:
Address configuration conflicts by:
- Ensuring proper model merging in the persistent container setup
- Verifying configuration names are consistent across the codebase
- Checking for duplicate model loading
- Resolving any conflicts in entity inheritance hierarchies
- Ensuring proper module names in Core Data model editor
<info added on 2025-06-13T16:18:59.329Z>
# RESOLVED: Core Data configuration conflicts successfully fixed!

## Root Cause Analysis:
The Core Data configuration conflicts were caused by a mismatch between the expected delete behavior in tests and the actual Core Data model configuration. The tests expected cascade delete behavior, but the Core Data model had no delete rules specified (defaulting to "Nullify").

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. **Updated Core Data Model Delete Rules**:
- **Project relationships**: Added `deletionRule="Cascade"` for patterns, kits, and presets (owned entities)
- **Pattern relationships**: Added `deletionRule="Cascade"` for tracks and trigs (owned entities), `deletionRule="Nullify"` for project and kit (references)
- **Track relationships**: Added `deletionRule="Cascade"` for trigs (owned entities), `deletionRule="Nullify"` for pattern, kit, and preset (references)
- **All other relationships**: Set to `deletionRule="Nullify"` to maintain referential integrity

### 2. **Updated Test Model to Match**:
- Modified the programmatic test model in `CoreDataTestBase.swift` to include the same delete rules
- Added proper `.cascadeDeleteRule` and `.nullifyDeleteRule` settings to all relationships
- Fixed missing relationship references (removed non-existent `kitPattern` relationship)

### 3. **Verified Cascade Delete Behavior**:
- **Project deletion**: Now properly cascades to delete all owned patterns, kits, and presets
- **Pattern deletion**: Now properly cascades to delete all owned tracks and trigs
- **Track deletion**: Now properly cascades to delete all owned trigs
- **Reference relationships**: Properly nullified when referenced entities are deleted

## Test Results:
- All 99 tests now pass (previously 9 failing relationship tests)
- Swift package build: SUCCESS
- iOS build with xcodebuild: SUCCESS
- No NSManagedObject subclass conflicts
- Proper cascade delete behavior working as expected

## Technical Details:
The fix ensures that the Core Data model now properly handles entity lifecycle management:
- **Owned entities** (patterns belong to projects, tracks belong to patterns, etc.) are cascade deleted
- **Referenced entities** (kit references from tracks, preset references from tracks) are nullified
- This prevents orphaned entities while maintaining data integrity

The configuration now matches the expected behavior defined in the test suite, resolving all Core Data configuration conflicts.

## 19. Fix Failing Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 3.17, 3.18
### Description: Fix the 39 failing tests out of 99 total tests
### Details:
Systematically address each failing test by:
- Grouping tests by failure pattern
- Fixing the underlying entity conflict issues
- Updating test setup code to avoid entity conflicts
- Ensuring proper test teardown to prevent cross-test contamination
- Verifying that fixed tests don't introduce new failures
<info added on 2025-06-13T16:22:16.680Z>
✅ COMPLETED: All failing tests have been successfully fixed!

## Current Test Status:
- **99 tests executed, 0 failures** - 100% pass rate
- All test suites passing successfully
- No NSManagedObject subclass conflicts
- No Core Data configuration issues

## Root Cause Analysis:
The failing tests were resolved by the previous subtasks (3.17 and 3.18):

1. **Task 3.17**: Fixed NSManagedObject subclass generation issues by replacing multiple programmatic Core Data models with a single shared model
2. **Task 3.18**: Fixed Core Data configuration conflicts by adding proper delete rules to the Core Data model

## Verification Results:

### Swift Package Tests:
- All 99 tests passing
- No compilation errors
- No runtime errors
- Clean test execution in 0.138 seconds

### iOS Build Verification:
- Xcode project generation: ✅ SUCCESS
- iOS build compilation: ✅ SUCCESS  
- All dependencies resolved correctly
- No build warnings or errors

## Test Suite Breakdown:
- **AppShellTests**: 1/1 tests passing
- **AudioEngineTests**: 1/1 tests passing  
- **CRUDOperationTests**: 22/22 tests passing
- **CRUDTests**: 10/10 tests passing

- **UIComponentsTests**: 1/1 tests passing
- **ValidationTests**: 9/9 tests passing
- **VoiceModuleTests**: 1/1 tests passing

## Key Achievements:

3. **Robust test infrastructure** - All test suites running cleanly
4. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Both Swift Package and iOS builds successful
