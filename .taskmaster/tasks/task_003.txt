# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement DataLayer Swift Package
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the DataLayer Swift Package with Core Data stack and persistence logic.
# Details:
Implement the DataLayer Swift Package with:
- PersistenceController for managing the Core Data stack
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Migration support for future schema changes
- Methods for creating default/template projects
- Utility methods for common data operations

Use the latest Core Data best practices including NSPersistentContainer and performBackgroundTask for thread safety. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive unit tests for the persistence layer. Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting all entity types. Test relationships and cascading deletes. Verify that the persistence controller initializes correctly in both memory and disk configurations.
