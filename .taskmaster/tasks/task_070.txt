# Task ID: 70
# Title: Implement UI Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 19, 32, 33, 34
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create UI tests for critical user flows.
# Details:
Implement UI tests with:
- Test coverage for critical user flows

Run tests to capture baseline screenshots of all key pages and components for future comparisons.

## 10. Implement cross-browser testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 70.6
### Description: Extend tests to run on multiple browsers and devices
### Details:
Configure tests to run on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile devices if applicable.

## 11. Set up performance testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 70.6
### Description: Implement basic performance tests for critical user flows
