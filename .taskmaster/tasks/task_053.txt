# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Arpeggiator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Add an arpeggiator for melodic pattern generation.
# Details:
Implement an arpeggiator with:
- Mode selection (up, down, random, etc.)
- Rate and range controls
- Hold functionality
- Integration with the sequencer

Implement the arpeggiator logic. Add UI for controlling arpeggiator parameters. Implement hold functionality for sustained arpeggios. Integrate with the sequencer for synchronized operation.

# Test Strategy:
Test arpeggiator with various modes and settings. Verify that arpeggios are correctly generated. Test hold functionality. Test integration with the sequencer and synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up VIPER architecture for arpeggiator module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic VIPER structure for the arpeggiator feature, including View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router components.
### Details:
1. Create empty files for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router
2. Define basic protocols for each component
3. Implement basic initialization and connections between components
4. Write unit tests for component interactions

## 2. Implement core arpeggiator logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core arpeggiator functionality using test-driven development approach.
### Details:
1. Write unit tests for arpeggiator patterns and note generation
2. Implement arpeggiator logic in the Interactor
3. Create mock objects for testing
4. Ensure all tests pass and cover edge cases

## 3. Design and implement arpeggiator UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 53.2
### Description: Create a user interface for the arpeggiator with basic controls and visual feedback.
### Details:
1. Design UI mockups for arpeggiator controls
2. Implement UI elements in the View component
3. Connect UI to Presenter logic
4. Write UI automation tests for user interactions
5. Perform integration tests between UI and core logic
