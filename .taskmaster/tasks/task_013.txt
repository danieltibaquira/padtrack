# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Global Send Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the global send effects (Delay, Reverb, Chorus).
# Details:
Implement the global send effects with:
- Delay: Stereo delay with feedback, time, and filter controls
- Reverb: Algorithmic reverb with size, damping, and modulation
- Chorus: Multi-voice chorus with depth and rate controls

Implement send routing architecture with per-track send levels. Use efficient algorithms suitable for mobile devices. For reverb, consider using a feedback delay network (FDN) design for quality and efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Test each effect with various input signals. Verify parameter ranges produce musically useful results. Test CPU usage under heavy load. Ensure effects can be bypassed cleanly.
