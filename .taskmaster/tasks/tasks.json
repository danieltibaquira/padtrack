Undo/Redo Testing:\n   - Create test scenarios for each editable component\n   - Perform complex sequences of operations followed by undo/redo\n   - Test maximum undo stack depth\n   - Verify state consistency after undo/redo operations\n   - Test undo/redo across different application contexts\n\n4. Copy/Paste Testing:\n   - Create test cases for copying and pasting each supported element type\n   - Test cross-pattern and cross-project paste operations\n   - Verify clipboard contents persist appropriately\n   - Test invalid paste operations and error handling\n\n5. Settings Testing:\n   - Verify each setting can be modified and persists after app restart\n   - Test settings reset functionality\n   - Verify settings changes properly affect application behavior\n   - Test settings UI for usability and clarity\n\n6. Help System Testing:\n   - Verify help content for each feature\n   - Test context-sensitive help accuracy\n   - Validate tutorial system completeness\n   - Test help search functionality with various queries\n\n7. Reporting:\n   - Create a comprehensive test report with sections for each feature area\n   - Include device-specific findings and screenshots\n   - Rate each feature area for compliance and completeness\n   - Document any bugs with severity ratings and reproduction steps\n   - Provide recommendations for improvements\n\n8. Validation:\n   - Have a second tester verify critical findings\n   - Conduct user testing with individuals who rely on accessibility features\n   - Compare results against accessibility guidelines and requirements",

      "details": "This task involves setting up the complete project structure to support modular development:\n\n1. Create a new Git repository for the DigitonePad project\n2. Configure the root directory with:\n   - project.yml file for Xcodegen with the following configuration:\n     - Main application target (DigitonePad)\n     - Development, staging, and production schemes\n     - Proper linking of all Swift Package dependencies\n     - Build settings for iPad deployment\n     - Code signing configuration\n\n3. Create the following Swift Package directories with proper Package.swift files:\n   - AppShell: Main application shell and coordination\n   - AudioEngine: Core audio processing and routing\n   - DataLayer: Data persistence and model definitions\n   - SequencerModule: Pattern sequencing and timing\n   - VoiceModule: Sound synthesis components\n   - FilterModule: Audio filtering components\n   - FXModule: Audio effects processing\n   - MIDIModule: MIDI input/output handling\n   - UIComponents: Reusable UI elements\n   - MachineProtocols: Interface definitions for audio components\n\n4. For each Swift Package:\n   - Define appropriate dependencies between packages\n   - Setup proper package product and target definitions\n   - Configure test targets\n   - Add README.md with package purpose and usage\n\n5. Create comprehensive .gitignore file including:\n   - Xcode build artifacts\n   - User-specific Xcode files\n   - Swift Package Manager artifacts\n   - macOS system files\n   - Generated Xcode project files\n\n6. Add README.md to the root with:\n   - Project overview\n   - Setup instructions\n   - Development workflow\n   - Contribution guidelines\n\n7. Setup initial CI configuration for basic build validation",
      "testStrategy": "1. Run Xcodegen to verify project generation:\n   ```\n   xcodegen generate\n   ```\n   - Confirm DigitonePad.xcodeproj is created without errors\n   - Verify all targets are properly configured\n\n2. Build each Swift Package independently:\n   ```\n   cd [PackageName]\n   swift build\n   ```\n   - Verify each package builds successfully\n   - Run any package tests with `swift test`\n\n3. Open the generated Xcode project and build the main application:\n   - Verify all dependencies are properly linked\n   - Ensure the project builds without errors or warnings\n   - Confirm the application launches in the simulator\n\n4. Verify Git repository functionality:\n   - Confirm .gitignore is working correctly by checking status\n   - Make an initial commit and push to remote repository\n   - Verify CI build is triggered and passes\n\n5. Document any setup issues or additional configuration needed for team members",
