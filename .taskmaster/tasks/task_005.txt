# Task ID: 5
# Title: Setup AudioEngine Swift Package Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the AudioEngine Swift Package with AVAudioEngine setup and basic audio routing.
# Details:
Implement the AudioEngine Swift Package with:
- AudioEngineManager class to handle AVAudioEngine lifecycle
- AudioGraphManager for managing the node connection graph
- Basic audio node types (source, processor, mixer)
- Audio buffer utilities and helper functions
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

Use AVAudioEngine with AUv3 architecture. Configure for low-latency operation with appropriate buffer sizes (256 or 512 samples). Implement proper error handling for audio session interruptions.
