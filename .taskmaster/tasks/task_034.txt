# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement STEP Recording Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the STEP recording mode for step-by-step input.
# Details:
Implement STEP recording mode with:
- Step-by-step note entry
- Automatic advancement to next step
- Note property editing (velocity, length)
- Integration with P-Lock system

Implement the UI and interaction logic for STEP mode. Add support for entering notes one step at a time. Implement automatic advancement to the next step after note entry. Integrate with the existing sequencer and data model.

# Test Strategy:
Test step-by-step note entry. Verify that notes are correctly stored in the data model. Test automatic advancement. Test with various pattern lengths and time signatures.
