# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement GRID Recording Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the GRID recording mode for step-based input.
# Details:
Implement GRID recording mode with:
- Step button interaction for placing/removing notes
- Visual feedback for active steps
- Integration with P-Lock system
- Support for setting note properties (velocity, length)

Implement the UI and interaction logic for GRID mode. Add support for selecting steps and modifying their properties. Integrate with the existing sequencer and data model.

# Test Strategy:
Test step creation and deletion. Verify that steps are correctly stored in the data model. Test interaction with P-Locks. Test with various pattern lengths and time signatures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Grid Recording Mode UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the user interface for the grid recording mode following VIPER architecture principles
### Details:
1. Design and implement the View layer for grid recording mode
2. Create a ViewController to handle user interactions
3. Implement a Presenter to manage the View's logic
4. Write unit tests for the Presenter
5. Create UI automation tests for the grid recording mode interface

## 2. Develop Grid Recording Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core functionality for grid recording mode using test-driven development
### Details:
1. Write unit tests for the Interactor responsible for grid recording logic
2. Implement the Interactor to handle grid recording functionality
3. Create an Entity to represent grid data
4. Develop a Router to manage navigation within the grid recording feature
5. Implement integration tests to ensure proper communication between components

## 3. Integrate Grid Recording with Existing Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Ensure proper integration of the grid recording mode with other app modules
### Details:
1. Update the app's main Router to include the grid recording feature
2. Modify existing modules to support grid recording mode
3. Implement data persistence for grid recordings
4. Write integration tests to verify proper interaction between modules
5. Conduct end-to-end testing of the grid recording feature within the app
