# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement MIDIModule Swift Package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the MIDIModule Swift Package for MIDI I/O.
# Details:
Implement the MIDIModule Swift Package with:
- CoreMIDI integration for input and output
- MIDI device discovery and connection
- MIDI message parsing and generation
- MIDI clock synchronization

Use CoreMIDI framework for low-level MIDI operations. Implement device discovery and connection management. Add support for common MIDI message types (Note On/Off, CC, Program Change, etc.). Implement MIDI clock synchronization for tempo sync.

# Test Strategy:
Test MIDI input and output with virtual MIDI ports. Verify that MIDI messages are correctly parsed and generated. Test device discovery and connection. Test MIDI clock synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up VIPER architecture for MIDIModule [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic VIPER structure for the MIDIModule Swift package, including View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router components.
### Details:
1. Create a new Swift package named MIDIModule
2. Set up folders for each VIPER component
3. Create protocol files for each component
4. Implement basic structs/classes for each component

## 2. Implement core MIDI functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core MIDI functionality in the Interactor, following TDD principles.
### Details:
1. Write unit tests for MIDI message handling
2. Implement MIDI message parsing in the Interactor
3. Write integration tests for MIDI input/output
4. Implement MIDI input/output functionality

## Core MIDI functionality implementation completed

### Comprehensive Unit Tests Created:
- MIDIMessage creation and validation tests
- MIDIMessageType raw value verification
- MIDIDevice creation and property tests
- MIDIConfiguration default value tests
- MIDIError handling and message tests
- MIDIInteractor initialization and functionality tests
- Mock presenter for testing VIPER interactions
- Integration tests for VIPER components
- MIDIManager singleton and legacy interface tests

### MIDI Message Parsing Implemented:
- processMIDIEvent() method for parsing raw MIDI data
- Support for all major MIDI message types (Note On/Off, CC, Program Change, Pitch Bend)
- Proper channel extraction and data validation
- Message forwarding to presenter and input handlers

### MIDI Input/Output Functionality:
- CoreMIDI client and port setup
- Device discovery for input/output devices
- Connection/disconnection handling with proper resource cleanup
- MIDI message sending with packet creation
- Input handling with event processing
- Error handling throughout the MIDI pipeline

### Integration with VIPER Architecture:
- All components properly tested and wired
- Mock objects for isolated unit testing
- Integration tests verify component interaction

Note: UIComponents module has unrelated UIKit compilation issues on macOS that don't affect MIDIModule functionality. The MIDIModule itself compiles and functions correctly with comprehensive test coverage following TDD principles.

## 3. Create basic UI for MIDI interaction [done]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Develop a simple UI in the View component to demonstrate MIDI functionality and allow for early visual progress.
### Details:
1. Design a basic UI mockup
2. Implement UI elements in SwiftUI
3. Connect UI to Presenter
4. Write UI automation tests

# UI Implementation Complete

## Comprehensive SwiftUI Interface Created
- MIDISwiftUIView: Main interface with device status, MIDI activity monitor, and test controls
- MIDIDeviceListView: Modal sheet for device discovery and connection management
- MIDIDeviceRow: Individual device display with connect/disconnect actions
- MIDIMessageRow: Real-time MIDI message display with type and data visualization
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/macOS) using pure SwiftUI

## MVVM Architecture with VIPER Integration
- MIDIViewModel: ObservableObject that bridges SwiftUI to VIPER architecture
- Reactive state management with @Published properties
- Proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Full integration with existing VIPER components (Presenter, Interactor, Router)

## Interactive UI Elements
- Device connection status indicator with color coding
- Real-time MIDI activity monitor showing last 10 messages
- Test note buttons (C4-C5 scale) for MIDI output testing
- Control Change test buttons (Volume, Pan)
- Device discovery and connection management
- Error handling and loading states

## Comprehensive UI Tests
- MIDIUITests: ViewModel state management and VIPER integration tests
- MIDISwiftUIViewTests: SwiftUI view creation and component tests
- MIDIUIIntegrationTests: Full workflow testing from initialization to MIDI handling
- Extension tests for display names and color mappings
- Preview support for SwiftUI development

## User Experience Features
- Intuitive device management with online/offline status
- Visual feedback for MIDI activity with recent message highlighting
- Disabled state handling for controls when no devices connected
- Clean, modern SwiftUI design following Apple HIG
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
