# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Basic Track Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the basic per-track effects (Bit Reduction, Sample Rate Reduction, Overdrive).
# Details:
Implement the track effects with:
- Bit Reduction: Variable bit depth reduction from 16-bit down to 1-bit
- Sample Rate Reduction: Downsampling with optional anti-aliasing
- Overdrive: Soft clipping distortion with variable drive amount

Implement each effect as a separate processor that can be chained. Use efficient algorithms that minimize CPU usage. Add bypass options for each effect.

# Test Strategy:
Test each effect individually for the expected sonic result. Verify parameter ranges produce usable sounds. Test extreme settings for stability. Perform FFT analysis to verify the spectral changes match expectations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement bit reduction algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to reduce the bit depth of audio samples
### Details:
Design and implement a bit reduction algorithm that can decrease the bit depth of audio samples. Include options for different bit depths (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit). Ensure proper scaling and dithering to minimize quantization noise.

## 2. Develop sample rate reduction with anti-aliasing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a function to reduce sample rate while preventing aliasing
### Details:
Implement a sample rate reduction algorithm with built-in anti-aliasing. Use a low-pass filter before downsampling to prevent aliasing artifacts. Allow for variable sample rate reduction factors.

## 3. Create overdrive effect with soft clipping [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement an overdrive effect using a soft clipping algorithm
### Details:
Design and implement a soft clipping algorithm for overdrive effect. Include adjustable parameters for drive amount and tone shaping. Ensure smooth transition between clean and distorted signals.

## 4. Design effect chaining mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Create a system to chain multiple audio effects together
### Details:
Develop a flexible effect chaining mechanism that allows multiple effects to be applied in series. Ensure proper signal flow and parameter management between effects.

## 5. Implement bypass functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Add the ability to bypass individual effects or the entire chain
### Details:
Create a bypass system that allows users to enable or disable individual effects or the entire effect chain. Implement smooth transitions when bypassing to avoid audio clicks or pops.

## 6. Optimize performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Optimize the effects processing for real-time performance
### Details:
Profile and optimize the effects processing code for real-time performance. Minimize CPU usage and reduce latency where possible. Consider using SIMD instructions or multi-threading if appropriate.

## 7. Create user interface for effect control [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Design and implement a user interface for controlling effect parameters
### Details:
Develop a user-friendly interface for controlling effect parameters, chaining, and bypass. Include visual feedback for effect status and parameter values. Ensure responsive and intuitive control for real-time manipulation.
