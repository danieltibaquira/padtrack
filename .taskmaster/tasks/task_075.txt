# Task ID: 75
# Title: Final Performance and Stability Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 67, 68, 69, 70, 71
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct final performance and stability testing before release.
# Details:
Conduct final testing with:
- Comprehensive performance profiling
- Stress testing under heavy load
- Long-duration stability testing
- Testing on all supported iPad models

Use Instruments for comprehensive performance profiling. Conduct stress testing with complex projects and heavy CPU load. Perform long-duration stability testing to catch memory leaks and resource issues. Test on all supported iPad models to ensure compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Profile performance on all supported iPad models. Verify that the application remains stable under heavy load. Test for extended periods to catch memory leaks and resource issues. Ensure that all critical bugs are fixed before release.
