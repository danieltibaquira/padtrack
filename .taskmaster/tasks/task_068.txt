# Task ID: 68
# Title: Implement Voice Stealing Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a voice stealing algorithm for managing polyphony.
# Details:
Implement voice stealing with:
- Priority-based voice allocation
- Stealing strategies (oldest, quietest, etc.)
- Release phase handling
- CPU load monitoring

Implement the voice stealing algorithm for managing limited polyphony. Add priority-based voice allocation for important notes. Implement different stealing strategies for flexibility. Add CPU load monitoring to adjust polyphony dynamically.

# Test Strategy:
Test with high polyphony demands. Verify that voice stealing behaves as expected. Test different stealing strategies. Test with CPU load monitoring to ensure stability under heavy load.
