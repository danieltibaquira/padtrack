# Description: Add undo and redo functionality for user actions.
# Details:
Implement the undo/redo system with:
- Command pattern for action tracking
- Undo and redo stacks
- UI controls for undo/redo
- Integration with the data model

Implement the command pattern for tracking user actions. Add undo and redo stacks for storing commands. Implement UI controls for undo/redo operations. Integrate with the data model for state management.

# Test Strategy:
