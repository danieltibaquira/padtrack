# Task ID: 84
# Title: Implement Cross-Device Testing for Mixer and Track Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 45, 46
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and execute a comprehensive testing plan to validate mixer implementation and mute/solo functionality across multiple iPad devices, ensuring professional mixing capabilities and efficient workflow.
# Details:
This task involves creating a structured testing framework to validate the mixer and track management functionality across different iPad devices:

1. Create a test matrix covering all required devices:
   - iPad Pro 11-inch
   - iPad Pro 12.9-inch
   - iPad Air
   - iPad mini

2. Develop test cases for each of the following areas:
   - Mixer control accuracy: Verify that volume, pan, and send level controls produce the expected audio output changes with precise measurements
   - Mute/solo reliability: Test that mute completely silences tracks and solo correctly isolates tracks in various combinations
   - Audio routing correctness: Validate that signal flow through the mixer matches the expected routing diagram
   - Fader smoothness: Test for zipper noise or discontinuities when adjusting parameters
   - Mixing workflow efficiency: Evaluate the number of steps required for common mixing tasks

3. Implement automated tests where possible:
   - Create unit tests for mixer parameter accuracy
   - Develop integration tests for audio routing validation
   - Implement UI tests for workflow efficiency

4. Create a performance profiling suite:
   - CPU usage monitoring during mixing operations
   - Memory usage tracking with different numbers of tracks
   - Touch response latency measurements for mixer controls

5. Develop a regression test suite to ensure future changes don't break existing functionality.

6. Document all test procedures and expected results in a format that can be used for future testing cycles.

7. Create a reporting template that captures all test results in a standardized format for comparison across devices.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will follow these steps:

1. Device Setup:
   - Install the latest build on all test devices (iPad Pro 11-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch, iPad Air, iPad mini)
   - Configure each device with identical project files containing multiple tracks with various audio content

2. Mixer Control Accuracy Testing:
   - Use a reference tone generator and audio analysis tools to measure the actual output levels at various fader positions
   - Compare measured values with expected values (e.g., -6dB fader position should produce exactly -6dB attenuation)
   - Test pan controls by measuring left/right channel output at various positions
   - Verify send levels by measuring the input level at effect processors

3. Mute/Solo Functionality Testing:
   - Create test projects with multiple tracks playing simultaneously
   - Verify that muting a track completely silences it (measure for any audio leakage)
   - Test solo functionality in various combinations (single track, multiple tracks)
   - Verify proper behavior when rapidly toggling mute/solo states
   - Test edge cases like muting all tracks, soloing all tracks, etc.

4. Audio Routing Validation:
   - Use signal tracing techniques to verify audio flows correctly through the mixer
   - Test routing to and from send effects
   - Verify proper summing of multiple tracks

5. Fader Smoothness Testing:
   - Record audio while making rapid fader movements
   - Analyze recordings for discontinuities or zipper noise
   - Test with both touch and automated parameter changes

6. Workflow Efficiency Assessment:
   - Time common mixing tasks (e.g., balancing tracks, setting up effects)
   - Count number of taps/gestures required for frequent operations
   - Compare workflow efficiency across different device sizes

7. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document all test results with screenshots and audio recordings
   - Create a comprehensive report highlighting any issues found
   - Include performance metrics and comparison across devices
   - Make recommendations for any necessary improvements

8. Regression Testing:
   - After any fixes are implemented, repeat key tests to ensure issues are resolved
   - Verify no new issues have been introduced
