# Task ID: 63
# Title: Implement MIDI File Import/Export
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 41
# Priority: low
# Description: Add support for importing and exporting MIDI files.
# Details:
Implement MIDI file import/export with:
- Export of patterns and songs to MIDI files
- Import of MIDI files to patterns
- Format selection (SMF type 0/1)
- Track mapping for import/export

Implement the logic for reading and writing Standard MIDI Files. Add UI for import/export operations. Implement format selection and track mapping. Add integration with the file system and sharing functionality.
