# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Lowpass 4 Filter Machine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Lowpass 4 filter implementing the FilterMachine protocol.
# Details:
Implement the Lowpass 4 filter with:
- 4-pole (24dB/octave) lowpass response
- Resonance control with self-oscillation
- Cutoff frequency with keyboard tracking
- Drive/saturation stage

Use a ladder filter design for authentic analog sound. Implement proper coefficient calculation for stability across the frequency range. Add saturation with soft clipping for the drive stage.

# Test Strategy:
Test filter response at different cutoff frequencies and resonance values using FFT analysis. Verify that the 4-pole slope is correct (24dB/octave). Test self-oscillation behavior and stability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up VIPER architecture for lowpass filter module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic VIPER structure (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) for the lowpass filter feature
### Details:
1. Create empty files for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router
2. Define protocols for each component
3. Implement basic initialization and connections between components
4. Write unit tests for each component's initialization

## 2. Implement core lowpass filter algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core algorithm for the 4th order lowpass filter in the Interactor
### Details:
1. Research and choose appropriate 4th order lowpass filter algorithm
2. Implement the algorithm in the Interactor
3. Write comprehensive unit tests for the filter algorithm
4. Create mock data for testing various input scenarios

## 3. Develop UI for filter controls and visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Create the user interface for controlling the filter parameters and visualizing the filter output
### Details:
1. Design and implement UI components for filter parameter inputs
2. Create a graph or visualization component for displaying filter output
3. Implement data binding between UI and Presenter
4. Write UI automation tests for user interactions
5. Perform integration tests between UI, Presenter, and Interactor
