# Task ID: 91
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Swift Packages structure and Xcodegen configuration to establish the foundation for the DigitonePad application architecture.
# Details:
This task involves setting up the complete project structure to support modular development:

1. Create a new Git repository for the DigitonePad project
2. Configure the root directory with:
   - project.yml file for Xcodegen with the following configuration:
     - Main application target (DigitonePad)
     - Development, staging, and production schemes
     - Proper linking of all Swift Package dependencies
     - Build settings for iPad deployment
     - Code signing configuration

3. Create the following Swift Package directories with proper Package.swift files:
   - AppShell: Main application shell and coordination
   - AudioEngine: Core audio processing and routing
   - DataLayer: Data persistence and model definitions
   - SequencerModule: Pattern sequencing and timing
   - VoiceModule: Sound synthesis components
   - FilterModule: Audio filtering components
   - FXModule: Audio effects processing
   - MIDIModule: MIDI input/output handling
   - UIComponents: Reusable UI elements
   - MachineProtocols: Interface definitions for audio components

4. For each Swift Package:
   - Define appropriate dependencies between packages
   - Setup proper package product and target definitions
   - Configure test targets
   - Add README.md with package purpose and usage

5. Create comprehensive .gitignore file including:
   - Xcode build artifacts
   - User-specific Xcode files
   - Swift Package Manager artifacts
   - macOS system files
   - Generated Xcode project files

6. Add README.md to the root with:
   - Project overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Contribution guidelines

7. Setup initial CI configuration for basic build validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Run Xcodegen to verify project generation:
   ```
   xcodegen generate
   ```
   - Confirm DigitonePad.xcodeproj is created without errors
   - Verify all targets are properly configured

2. Build each Swift Package independently:
   ```
   cd [PackageName]
   swift build
   ```
   - Verify each package builds successfully
   - Run any package tests with `swift test`

3. Open the generated Xcode project and build the main application:
   - Verify all dependencies are properly linked
   - Ensure the project builds without errors or warnings
   - Confirm the application launches in the simulator

4. Verify Git repository functionality:
   - Confirm .gitignore is working correctly by checking status
   - Make an initial commit and push to remote repository
   - Verify CI build is triggered and passes

5. Document any setup issues or additional configuration needed for team members
