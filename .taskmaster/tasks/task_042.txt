# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement MIDI Input for Live Recording
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33, 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for recording notes from external MIDI controllers.
# Details:
Implement MIDI input for live recording with:
- MIDI note to sequencer note mapping
- Velocity and aftertouch handling
- Integration with LIVE recording mode
- MIDI channel routing to tracks

Connect MIDI input to the sequencer's live recording functionality. Implement mapping from MIDI notes to sequencer notes. Add support for velocity and aftertouch. Implement MIDI channel routing to direct input to specific tracks.

# Test Strategy:
Test recording notes from MIDI input. Verify that notes, velocity, and aftertouch are correctly captured. Test with different MIDI controllers. Test MIDI channel routing to tracks.
