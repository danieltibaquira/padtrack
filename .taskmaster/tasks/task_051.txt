# Task ID: 51
# Title: Implement Scale and Chord Modes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add scale and chord modes for the sequencer and keyboard.
# Details:
Implement scale and chord modes with:
- Scale selection (major, minor, modes, etc.)
- Chord selection and voicing
- Scale/chord highlighting on the keyboard
- Scale-constrained sequencing

Add scale and chord settings to the data model. Implement UI for selecting scales and chords. Add scale highlighting on the keyboard. Implement scale-constrained sequencing to keep notes within the selected scale.

# Test Strategy:
Test scale selection and highlighting. Verify that scale-constrained sequencing works correctly. Test with various scales and chords. Test changing scales during playback.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Scale Mode UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the user interface for the scale mode, including note display and selection
### Details:
1. Design UI mockups for scale mode
2. Implement view controller and view model following VIPER architecture
3. Create unit tests for view model logic
4. Implement UI elements (buttons, labels, etc.)
5. Add UI automation tests for basic interactions

## 2. Develop Chord Mode Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core logic for chord mode, including chord recognition and display
### Details:
1. Define chord data structures and algorithms
2. Implement chord recognition logic in the interactor layer
3. Create unit tests for chord recognition
4. Integrate chord logic with UI in the presenter
5. Implement integration tests for chord mode functionality

## 3. Integrate Scale and Chord Modes [pending]
### Dependencies: 51.2
### Description: Combine scale and chord modes, ensuring smooth transitions and data sharing between modes
### Details:
1. Implement mode switching mechanism
2. Ensure data consistency between modes
3. Create integration tests for mode switching
4. Implement UI for mode selection
5. Add UI automation tests for full workflow between modes
