# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Track Mixer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the track mixer for volume, pan, and send levels.
# Details:
Implement the track mixer with:
- Volume control for each track
- Pan control for each track
- Send levels for global effects
- Mute and solo functionality

Implement the audio routing and mixing infrastructure. Add UI for controlling mixer parameters. Implement mute and solo functionality. Ensure proper gain staging throughout the signal chain.

# Test Strategy:
Test volume, pan, and send controls for each track. Verify that mute and solo functionality works correctly. Test with multiple tracks active. Test extreme settings for stability.

## 1. Set up VIPER architecture for track mixer module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic VIPER structure (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) for the track mixer feature
### Details:
1. Create empty protocol files for View, Interactor, Presenter, and Router
2. Implement basic Entity structure for track representation
3. Set up unit test files for each VIPER component

## 2. Implement track mixer UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the user interface elements for the track mixer using test-driven development
### Details:
