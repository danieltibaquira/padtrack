# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Multi-Mode Filter
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Multi-Mode filter implementing the FilterMachine protocol.
# Details:
Implement the Multi-Mode filter with:
- Morphing between LP-BP-HP filter types
- Resonance control with self-oscillation capability
- Cutoff frequency with keyboard tracking
- Drive/saturation stage

Use a state-variable filter design for smooth morphing between filter types. Implement proper coefficient calculation for stability across the frequency range. Add saturation with soft clipping for the drive stage.

# Test Strategy:
Test filter response at different cutoff frequencies and resonance values using FFT analysis. Verify morphing between filter types produces the expected frequency response. Test self-oscillation behavior and stability.
