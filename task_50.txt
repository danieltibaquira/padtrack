Task 50: Implement On-Screen Keyboard
====================================

## Overview
Create the on-screen musical keyboard for note input with piano-style layout, velocity sensitivity, octave controls, and scale highlighting.

## Requirements
- Piano-style layout with multiple octaves
- Velocity sensitivity based on touch position
- Octave shift controls
- Scale and chord highlighting
- Touch handling for note input with velocity
- Musical guidance features

## Implementation Strategy
Following VIPER architecture principles and TDD approach.

## Subtasks Progress

### Subtask 50.1: Design On-Screen Keyboard UI
Status: Complete
- ✅ Define keyboard layout and key placement
- ✅ Create UI mockups for normal and pressed key states
- ✅ Design a simple view for the text input area
- ✅ Implement basic UI elements without functionality

Files created:
- OnScreenKeyboardProtocols.swift (VIPER protocols and data models)
- OnScreenKeyboardInteractor.swift (business logic)
- OnScreenKeyboardPresenter.swift (presentation logic)
- OnScreenKeyboardRouter.swift (navigation)
- OnScreenKeyboardView.swift (main SwiftUI view)
- KeyboardSelectorViews.swift (scale and chord selectors)

### Subtask 50.2: Implement Key Press Functionality
Status: Complete
- ✅ Write unit tests for key press events
- ✅ Implement key press logic in the Interactor
- ✅ Create a Presenter to handle UI updates
- ✅ Connect the View to display pressed keys
- ✅ Run and refine unit tests

Files created:
- OnScreenKeyboardTests.swift (comprehensive unit tests)
- Enhanced all VIPER components with key press functionality
- Implemented velocity sensitivity and MIDI note generation
- Added polyphony management and octave controls

### Subtask 50.3: Integrate Text Input and Testing
Status: Complete
- ✅ Implement text input area update logic
- ✅ Write integration tests for keyboard and text input
- ✅ Develop UI automation tests for full keyboard functionality
- ✅ Perform end-to-end testing of the on-screen keyboard
- ✅ Refactor and optimize based on test results

Files created:
- OnScreenKeyboardIntegrationTests.swift (comprehensive integration tests)
- KeyboardDemoView.swift (demo application showing keyboard usage)
- Complete VIPER architecture implementation
- Full keyboard functionality with velocity sensitivity, scales, and chords

## Task 50 Summary
All subtasks completed successfully. Implemented a complete on-screen keyboard with:
- Piano-style layout with multiple octaves and customizable layouts
- Velocity sensitivity based on touch position
- Octave shift controls with proper range limiting
- Scale and chord highlighting with musical guidance
- VIPER architecture for maintainable code
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Demo application showing real-world usage

## Technical Decisions
- Using VIPER architecture for keyboard module
- Implementing in Sources/DigitonePad/OnScreenKeyboard/
- Following SwiftUI for UI implementation
- Using Combine for reactive programming
- Integrating with existing UIComponents package

## Dependencies
- UIComponents package (for consistent styling)
- SwiftUI framework
- Combine framework

## Validation Requirements
- Build with swift build/test
- Build with xcodebuild
- Run @run_validation.sh
- Run @generate_validation_summary.sh
- All validation must pass before updating task status
