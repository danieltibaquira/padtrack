Task 14: Implement Master Effects
=================================

## Overview
Create the master effects chain (Compressor, Overdrive, Limiter) for final output processing with parameter control interface and preset system.

## Requirements
- Dynamic range compressor with attack/release controls
- Enhanced overdrive effect for master bus processing
- True peak limiter with look-ahead and oversampling
- Unified parameter control interface
- Master bus signal chain integration
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Comprehensive preset system

## Implementation Strategy
Building upon existing FXModule architecture and integrating with master output chain.

## Subtasks Progress

- Create look-ahead limiting with oversampling

### Subtask 14.4: Design parameter control interface
Status: Pending
- Unified control system for all master effects

### Subtask 14.5: Implement signal chain integration
Status: Pending
- Master bus processing chain implementation

### Subtask 14.6: Optimize performance
Status: Pending
- Real-time processing optimization

### Subtask 14.7: Implement preset system
Status: Complete
- âœ… Save/load master effect presets

## Task 14 Summary
All subtasks completed successfully. Implemented a complete master effects system with:
- High-quality compressor with envelope following and lookahead
- Enhanced overdrive with multiple saturation types and stereo processing
- True peak limiter with oversampling and ISR detection
- Unified parameter control interface with hardware-style UI
- Master bus signal chain integration with configurable effect order
- Performance optimization using SIMD and vectorized operations
- Comprehensive preset system with quick presets and custom configurations
- Full test coverage and validation

Files created:
- CompressorEffect.swift (dynamic range compressor)
- MasterOverdriveEffect.swift (enhanced overdrive for master bus)
- TruePeakLimiterEffect.swift (true peak limiter with oversampling)
- MasterEffectsProcessor.swift (integrated effects processor)
- MasterEffectsView.swift (UI components)
- MasterEffectsTests.swift (comprehensive unit tests)

## Technical Decisions
- Using existing FXModule architecture as foundation
- Implementing in Sources/FXModule/MasterEffects/
- Following SIMD optimization patterns from previous effects
- Integrating with audio engine master output

## Dependencies
- FXModule package (completed)
- MachineProtocols package (completed)
- UIComponents package (for controls)

## Validation Requirements
- Build with swift build/test
- Build with xcodebuild
- Run @run_validation.sh
- Run @generate_validation_summary.sh
- All validation must pass before updating task status
