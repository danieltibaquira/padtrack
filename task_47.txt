Task 47: Implement Project Management
==========================================

## Overview
Create the system for creating, saving, and loading projects using VIPER architecture and TDD principles.

## Requirements
- UI for creating new projects
- Saving and loading projects
- Project metadata (name, author, tempo, etc.)
- Auto-save functionality

## Implementation Strategy
Following VIPER architecture with Test-Driven Development.

## Subtasks Progress

### Subtask 47.1: Set up VIPER architecture skeleton
Status: Complete
- ✅ Create project folders for each VIPER component
- ✅ Add placeholder files for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router
- ✅ Set up basic protocols for communication between components

Files created:
- ProjectManagementProtocols.swift (protocols and view models)
- ProjectManagementInteractor.swift (business logic)
- ProjectManagementPresenter.swift (presentation logic)
- ProjectManagementRouter.swift (navigation)
- ProjectManagementView.swift (SwiftUI view)

### Subtask 47.2: Implement core UI components with TDD
Status: Complete
- ✅ Write unit tests for UI components
- ✅ Implement UI components to pass tests
- ✅ Create basic layout and navigation structure
- ✅ Set up UI automation tests for critical user flows

Files created:
- ProjectManagementTests.swift (unit tests for VIPER components)
- ProjectManagementUITests.swift (UI automation tests)
- Updated Package.swift to include ViewInspector dependency
- Created comprehensive test coverage for presenter, interactor, and view components

### Subtask 47.3: Develop and test core functionality
Status: Complete
- ✅ Write unit tests for core business logic
- ✅ Implement business logic in Interactor
- ✅ Develop Presenter logic with unit tests
- ✅ Integrate components and write integration tests
- ✅ Perform manual testing of the integrated functionality

Files created:
- AppState.swift (global app state management)
- Updated ContentView.swift (integrated project management)
- Updated MainLayoutView.swift (added project menu button)
- ProjectManagementIntegrationTests.swift (comprehensive integration tests)
- Fixed DataLayer integration issues
- Implemented complete VIPER flow with auto-save functionality

## Technical Decisions
- Using existing Project entity from DataLayer
- Implementing VIPER architecture in Sources/DigitonePad/ProjectManagement/
- Following SwiftUI for UI implementation
- Using Combine for reactive programming

## Dependencies
- DataLayer package (Project entity)
- UIComponents package (for consistent styling)
- SwiftUI framework

## Validation Requirements
- Build with swift build/test
- Build with xcodebuild
- Run @run_validation.sh
- Run @generate_validation_summary.sh
- All validation must pass before updating task status
